<p>When Hurricane María decimated Puerto Rico from coast to coast on September 20, it destroyed its outdated and already delicate power grid. In the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, 99 percent of Puerto Ricans were without power.</p>

<p>The website status.pr, created by the Government of Puerto Rico and powered by the Puerto Rico Innovation Technology Service, has been informing citizens on the status of various infrastructure and social sectors in the island post-hurricane since September 29. However, the site has been updating the status of the island’s electrical infrastructure based on the percentage of power generation, not energization. This means the site reflects how much power capacity is being generated, not how many people actually have power.</p>

<p>Actually getting those figures, experts say, is not possible at the moment, as explained by Jorge Bracero, an auxiliary operator at the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)--the island’s only electrical energy company. In an interview with NotiCel, Bracero claims that the corporation’s fiber-optic system was destroyed along with its transmission and distribution lines. Without a fiber optic system, knowing who has and who doesn’t have power is impossible.</p>

<p>“That information is transmitted through the fiber optic system. Once that’s fixed, the feeder will generate a new compilation of who has and who doesn’t have power,” Bracero said. “Everything is done through that system. It won’t be up until we have enough transmission.”</p>

<p>Bracero also said that there is no estimated date for when that will be possible.</p>

<p>Bracero gained overnight fame  when he began sharing the schedule and locations of power brigades around the island every day through his personal Facebook page. He eventually created a professional page, which now has almost 63,000 “likes.”</p>
